# Home Work â„–4 "Caching in Java"
    Your home task for the "Caching in Java" lecture is to implement a read-through write-behind LFU cache. 
    You can find a small project in the attachments. It contains an interface for the cache you should implement. It should be ONE implementation with three mentioned properties - read-through, write-behind, LFU. Cache interface has docs that explain how it should work. There is also a test, that describes the expected behavior. It fails now and should pass once you are finished. In case you are not certain about something, you can make the decision with your mentor, just mention all your assumptions in the result letter you send me or in a readme. 
    

##Steps :
1. Import existing sources to a new solution.
2. Implemented LFU Cache.{CacheFactory.java, ListFirstUsedCache.java}.
